  <p>Our site is simply required to store all personal information that is available. All protection is by encryption. This applies to even credit cards during transfer and storage. We also encrypt sensitive data, such as geographic information in the transmission. For other types of information, we also use reasonable measures to prevent disclosure of information to persons not described in this policy. It is very important for us to protect you from fraudsters, from unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.
